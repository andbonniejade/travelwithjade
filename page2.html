    <div class="first_p" ><p> Growing up, I spent every summer holiday traveling around the UK with my mum.<br>
        I didn't get on a plane until I was twelve years old!  <br>
        My first holiday was third-wheeling my parents on thier honeymoon to Dubai. </p>

            <p>After I graduated from university, I was lucky to land my first job working as an air stewardess. <br>
            From this moment onwards, my travel life 'took off!.' Pun intended. </p>  
            <p> Cabin crew really changed my life.  I realised there is so much of the world to see, explore and experience.</p>

            <div class="sidetext"><p> Now, earlier I mentioned that travel costs money and I haven't always had the luxury to travel.</p>  
                    <p>Mentioning this now is intentional. 
                    I no longer work as a flight attendant. </p>
                    <p>I decided to stop during the corona virus outbreak to see what else life has to offer. </p>

                    <p>But this, doesn't mean I have stopped travelling. 
                    I travel more now, and for longer periods of time.  I just do it on a budget.</p>
            
                    <p>Affordable travel is so easy and I can share my tips with you!
                    Travel is good for the soul, broadens your outlook on life and is an amazing way to meet new friends along the way. </p>
