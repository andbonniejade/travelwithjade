                <h3 class="p2"> 1. Why book through a booking agency when you can do it yourself, for a lot cheaper?</h3></div>
                <div>
                <p class="p2">Don't be afraid of booking your flights and hotels separately. Doing this may save you a lot of money. <br>
                    If you are travelling long-haul, the all-inclusive option may be worth wile in terms of transfers. But always check your options if you are travelling shorter distances, especially around Europe. 
                    
                <p class="p2"> My go to websites are        
                    <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/" target="_blank">
                    'Sky Scanner' 
                        </a> and 
                <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" target="_blank">

        <h3 class="p2"> 2. Save even more money by widening your net when looking for flights </h3>
    </div>
    <div>              
        <p class="p2"> Both

            <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" target="_blank">
                'Google Flights,' </a> allow you to search the best flights for any flight within a month.        
       </p>

       <p class="p2"> They will show you a list of destinations, prices, and operators for the entire month of your choice.  Searching this way will guarantee you will find a steal. <br>
        But be sure to book as early as possible!</p>
        
    </div>

    
        <div class="list_title">
    <h3> 3.	Beware of add-ons when <br>you are booking your flight </h3>
    </div>
        <div>    
        <p class="p2">Travel insurance, seats and baggage allowances are sometimes not included in the price of the flight you have chosen.  You don't have to add any of them.  </p> 
            
        <p class="p2"> The best option is to decline all these add-ons such as baggage until the very end of your booking process.  Leaving your baggage allowance until the very end will prompt a 'last- chance' buy offer.  You can see all your options here in terms of price for hold luggage verses cabin allowance.  </p>
        
    </div>
        

    <div class="list_title">
    <h3> 4.	Compare prices <br>for hotels across a variety of comparison sites </h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="p2">Yes, unfortunately this can be the most tedious part of the booking process.  But this is the most important part. <br>
            
        <p class="p2"> I generally use    and  to compare the prices of the same or similar hotels.

            Airbnb </a><br> 
            This could be the best option, especially if you are travelling with a group or family!<br>
            Check reviews, location of the accommodation and transport options for peace of mind. <br>

        <h3 class="p2"> 6.	Invest in a pre-paid travel card for your spending money- and wave goodbye to loose change</h3>
    </div>
    <div>    
        <p class="p2">Using a dedicated travel card can save you money in exchange fees.
            Card companies such as Revolut and Monzo, may allow you to withdraw cash overseas for free or at a lower rate. </p> 
         
        <p class="p2"> I got my first pre-paid travel card during my cabin crew days and I have never looked back!
            Hoping from one country to the next meant I could store all my currencies on one card.  Prepaid travel cards allow you to make an exchange instantaneously, as often as you need, at a good rate.</p>
            
        <p class="p2"> Check Money saving expert for a closer look at the options here.

        <h3 class="p2"> 7.	Don't be afraid of arranging your own commute from the airport to hotel</h3>
    </div>
    <div>    
        <p class="p2">Research, research, research!!- I always check public transport routes vs taxi services from the airport to your hotel.  You could save yourself so many coins opting to take the train.  Remember all airports should have transport to the centre. You can always take a taxi when youâ€™re a little closer to your destination.</p>
        
        <p class="p2"> I always use google maps before traveling. I will never choose a flight that lands far too late to catch a train or bus safely.   Arriving at a good time, during the daytime makes it much easier to commute.  </p>
        
    </div>


    <div class="list_title">
        <h3 class="p2"> 8.	Did you know you can bring your own food on the plane? </h3>
    </div>
    <div>    
        <p class="p2">We all know airport food and be costly.  Why not bring a sandwich for your travels and buy yourself to a treat when you get to the airport?  <br>
        If you bring solid foods rather than liquids, you will be fine.  Always check the rules to confirm what you bring with you.

    <div class="list_title">
        <h3 class="p2"> 9.	Buying your toiletries when you arrive at your destination from the supermarket could save you buying hold luggage.</h3>
    </div>
    <div>   
        <p class="p2">If buying hold luggage turns out to be expensive, just buy an extra cabin bag and buy your toiletries when you land.  </p>
            
        <p class="p2"> I have a few expensive liquids I must bring with me.  My makeup and face creams are none-negotiables. I will pack them in small travel containers to give me a little more space.</p>
